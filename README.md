# Verilog_Lint_Project
## Project Description:
### Project#1 Verilog Lint
In this project the students will design static Verilog Design Checker, the checker will take Verilog (DUT) no Test Bench, and statically points to following List of Violations
• Arithmetic Overflow
• Unreachable Blocks
• Unreachable FSM State
• Un-initialized Register
• Multi-Driven Bus/Register
• Non Full/Parallel Case
• Infer Latch
#### Requirements
• Select a name for your Verilog Linter
• You should be able to parse Verilog code that can have different combinations of above
constructs
• Verilog should be single Flatten Modules, No Hierarchy, No Instantiation
• Your Design should be only “Design Under Test” DUT no testbench is needed.
#### Your Lint EDA Product should have
o Parser
o Static Checker Engine
o Report Generator which produce a text file demonstrate
▪ Checks Name
▪ Line of Code it Happens in
▪ Signals/Variables Impacted Evaluation
• Student will demonstrate 3 Verilog Cases, demonstrates combination of the above HDL Constructs, and demonstrate Lint results, reports.
• Their results will be compared with commercial linter as validation of results
• Presentation demonstrates the design of 3 main blocks (parser, engine, debugger)
• Teams will schedule a 20 minutes demo/slides using MS to deliver the project
• Using whatever programming language you prefer or scripting language (Python, Perl, TCL,..)
• You need to upload your executable, source code, document /slides describe the algorithm/approach used.
