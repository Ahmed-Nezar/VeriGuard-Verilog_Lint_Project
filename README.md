# README for Verilog Coding Violations Examples

## Overview
This collection of Verilog modules is designed to demonstrate various common coding violations and issues in digital logic design. It is intended for educational purposes, to help students and designers understand and identify potential problems in their Verilog code.

## Modules and Violations
Each module in this collection showcases a different type of violation or issue:

1. **UnreachableBlocks**: Demonstrates unreachable code due to conditional logic.
2. **UninitializedRegister**: Shows the issue with using an uninitialized register.
3. **InferringLatches**: Illustrates how latches can be unintentionally inferred in combinational logic.
4. **UnreachableState**: Depicts an FSM (Finite State Machine) with an unreachable state.
5. **NonFullCase**: Highlights the problems caused by incomplete case statements.
6. **NonParallelCase**: Shows issues with non-parallel case statements.
7. **MultipleDrivers**: Demonstrates the problem of multiple drivers for a single wire.
8. **ArithmeticOverflow**: Shows potential overflow in arithmetic operations with fixed-size registers.

## File Description
- Each module is named according to the violation it demonstrates and is contained in its own Verilog file.
